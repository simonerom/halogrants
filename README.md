# Goalss
The IoTeX Halo Program, run by the IoTeX Foundation, funds community projects that benefit the IoTeX ecosystem. Specifically, Halo grants are targeted at **developers** interested in building IoT and privacy-related projects, as well as **ecosystem builders** that want to expand the capabilities/reach of the IoTeX Network. 

At a high level, we welcome two categories of proposals, both tech and non-tech:
# Community Bounties
Community bounties are a "wishlist" of new features, bug fixes, or standalone projects proposed by the community or by the IoTeX Foundation. Bounties have a well defined scope of work, verifiable deliveries, and a funding limit. Anyone can start a bounty to fund their favorite idea and help the growth of the IoTeX ecosystem, and anyone can work on existing bounties and claim the reward once work is done.


## Work on a bounty
If you are a developer, or an ecosystem builder, choose from the current [list of bounties](https://github.com/iotexproject/halogrants/issues) any project you feel confident to complete: pay special attention to the bounty description, the expected deliverables, and get in contact with the Bounty funder for clarifications by either commenting under the Bounty, or reaching out to the funder contacts.

**Please notice**: Bounties can have different formats, make sure to clarify with the funder if multiple people are allowed to work on the same bounty, what are the rules to select who gets paid. If you feel like you are the right person for a specific bounty, you may try asking to get it *reserved for you*.

## Fund a bounty
All IoTeX bounties are listed in the [issue section](https://github.com/iotexproject/halogrants/issues) of this repository: if there is a new feature, a bug fix, or a project that you would to get implemented on IoTeX, you can fund your own bounty by adding it to this repository issues:

<a href="https://github.com/iotexproject/halogrants/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=-bounty-title-.md&title=Set+the+feature+or+project+name+here"><img src="img/btn-create-bounty.png" height="42px"></a>

**Please notice**: if you create a bounty you are responsible for paying out the reward when work is submitted that fulfill all the requirements.

If you have a Gitcoin account, you may want to fund your bounty on Gitcoin to get more submissions:

# Open-ended Proposals 
Do you have a great project you want to build on IoTeX? Pitch us your idea! OEPs empower your innovative and impactful ideas with funding and hands-on technical support from the IoTeX Foundation.

## Types of Grants
Recommended proposal types include, but are not limited to:

**Technical** ([Template](https://github.com/iotexproject/halogrants/blob/master/rfp-proposals/rfp-proposal-template1.md))
- Trusted Devices/Data: new tools/capabilities for "Powered by IoTeX" products (e.g., Ucam, Pebble Tracker)
- New Devices/Dapps: onboard new smart devices, applications, and services to the IoTeX ecosystem
- Developer Experience: tools and software to make developing on IoTeX easier
- Infrastructure: wallets, explorer, decentralized exchange (DEX), datastore, etc.
- Decentralized Products: mobile applications, games, etc.

**Non-technical** ([Template](https://github.com/iotexproject/halogrants/blob/master/rfp-proposals/rfp-proposal-template2.md))
- Educational Materials: formal programs, tools, videos, or other multimedia to spread the word about IoTeX
- International Marketing: marketing campaigns, meetups, and initiatives in your local region/language
- Community Experience: long-term programs to help drive community discussion and engagement

## How to Apply
1. Anyone (individuals or teams) is welcome to submit their proposals via pull requests to this repo (follow the given [request for proposal templates](https://github.com/iotexproject/halogrants/tree/master/rfp-proposals) or get inspired by [approved open proposals](https://github.com/iotexproject/halogrants/tree/master/oep-proposals)). 
Once committed, please submit your proposal to the [IoTeX Forum - Technology & Developers](https://community.iotex.io/c/research-development/7) section for open discussion.
2. The IoTeX Foundation will review your proposal within two weeks. We will provide feedback/suggestions and optionally schedule a call to discuss your idea, after which we will approve/reject the proposal. We will expand the proposal selection committee as time goes by, including community leaders, project advisors, and external technologists.
3. If a grant is awarded, grant recipients will receive their IOTX grants periodically based on predetermined milestones for the specific grant. Note that the issuance of funding differs for RFPs and OEPs.
4. Grant recipients will be required to produce [Milestone Reports](https://github.com/iotexproject/halogrants/blob/master/deliveries/project_milestone_n_template.md) in order to continue to receive grant funding. If the Milestone Report shows the initiative is not meeting expectations, the Foundation will work with you to get back on track; however, if problems persist we may halt continued funding. The submission cycle of the Milestone Report will vary according to each projectâ€™s duration.

## Eligibility
1. Proposal should be clear about how they will benefit the IoTeX ecosystem. We are primarily interested in projects that can be completed in 3 months or less -- longer projects may be split into multiple grants for easier tracking/management.
2. Teams and individuals can apply for grants more than once, but they need to complete the previous project (as described in their application) before receiving additional funds.
3. Teams should not seek to cover 100% of their early-stage funding via Halo Grants alone.
4. All projects must be open-sourced (under MIT and APACHE2 licenses) and all teams must be self-managed.
